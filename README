-- framework - A simple web application framework using wsgi, Paste, and WebOB

framework is an attempt at writing a web frameowrk with the most flexability
and ease of use. It's not necessarily an advertised solution, for I plan on
keeping it to less than a thousand lines although we'll see how that works out.

-- Requirements
tempita
WebOb

Under examples, you'll find TestHarness.py, which shows two different ways to use these apps,
fcgi_handler.py works too.

lighttpd.conf is an example lighttpd configuration.
